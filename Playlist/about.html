        <h1>♫ About Spotify Playlists: The Three Types ♫</h1>
      </div>
    <div class="about">
        <h2>1. Spotify Editorial Playlists</h2>
        <p>These playlists are curated by Spotify’s Shows & Editorial team. This is a team of music experts and genre specialists from around the world. They’re hired by Spotify to curate and manage Spotify’s own playlists. These playlists have large followings and are the most well-known. They also tend to be genre specific or context-driven, like “Songs to Sing in the Shower” or “Relax and Unwind.”</p>
        <h2>2. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists</h2>
        <p>These playlists are automatically created for each Spotify user by Spotify’s software algorithms. Spotify monitors the user’s listening habits and gathers information to curate highly personalized playlists. Examples of algorithmic playlists include “Discover Weekly” and “Release Radar”. Discover Weekly is a weekly playlist that’s updated every Monday and unique for every user. This playlist features music that Spotify thinks that user is likely to enjoy, based on their particular Spotify listening habits.</p>
        <h2>3. Listener Playlists</h2>
        <p>These are playlists that are created and maintained by Spotify users themselves. Users can choose to make their playlists “secret” or “public”. While many Spotify users are simply regular users curating playlists for personal enjoyment, many businesses, companies, and public personalities also create their own playlists, usually as a way to extend their branding.</p>
